# Sprite tools

These scripts are kept on `master` for convenience, but they target the PixelLab
asset layout used on the `platformer` branch (e.g., `assets/sprites/pixellab`).

Run with `uv`:

```bash
uv run .tools/combine_sprites.py
uv run .tools/fetch_spriters_resource_sheets.py
uv run .tools/gen_placeholder_sprites.py
```

Switch to `platformer` when you want the full asset tree.
