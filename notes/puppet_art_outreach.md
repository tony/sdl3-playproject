Subject: Quick feedback request on tiny 8/16-bit character forms

Hi <name>,

I am iterating on a small SDL3 platformer sandbox with a procedural puppet
renderer. I am collecting expert feedback on making each character read
as iconic using a shared skeleton plus small pixel-grid accessories.

If you are open to it, could you fill in the template in
notes/puppet_art_brief.md and send it back? The brief is designed to be
self-contained and should take ~20–30 minutes per character if you
answer only the top-priority items.

Thanks!
<your name>
